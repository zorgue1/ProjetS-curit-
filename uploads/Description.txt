Execution Instructions:
There is a picture named `original.png` in the project files.
After running `challenge.py`, a new picture `challenge.png` will be generated.
Give `challenge.png` to the challenger and ask them to find the hidden secret in the image.

**Solution Steps:**
1. **Open the image and retrieve the pixels**
   - Convert the image to RGB mode and iterate through all the R, G, B channels of the pixels.
2. **Extract the least significant bits (LSB)**
   - Perform the `& 1` operation on each channel to get the corresponding bit (0 or 1) and concatenate them into a long binary string.
3. **Reconstruct the text**
   - Divide the binary string into 8-bit segments, convert each segment to an ASCII character, and concatenate them into a string.
4. **Cut off the terminator**
   - When the predefined terminator (e.g., `###EOF###`) is detected, discard the content after it to obtain the final hidden message.
For details, see the `solution.py` file.
